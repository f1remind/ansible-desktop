# Description
This is a setup for my desktop stuff.
It'll grow with time but for now it only installs the very basics.

Since I usually run my stuff on Debian flavored systems there's no support for other flavors.



# Development tools
* Tmux + Vim for pretty much everything
* VSCode for JavaScript frontends
